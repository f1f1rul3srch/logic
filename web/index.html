				<h1>LOGIC</h1>
				<h3>A modern, lightweight JavaScript form validator.</h3>
				<p>Logic was designed and built by the team that brought you Reach, the guys that made messaging awesome.</p>
				<p>We built Logic to help us internally, but we think it's so great that we had to share it.</p>
				<p>We hope you love using it as much as we do.</p>
